Places Manager for Android

Placemark Manager is an easy to use application to save, and recall places that you've been to, and places that you want to go.  All of this accomplished using an intuitive interface similar to a file manager.   Whether you're a truck driver navigating to and from new or familiar customer locations, a geocaching wizard, or a salesman trying to keep track of your customers, Placemark Manager has your back!  Think of it as a GPS address book.

Click the Add button to save a place, give it a name, and Places will do the rest!

All saved locations are saved as placemarks, commonly known as points of interest or waypoints in other software.  They can easily be exported as KML files, compatible with Google Earth.  Conversely, you can import KML or KMZ files to import placemarks from other sources, or your own backups.

* Store hundreds of locations neatly organized in folders the way you like.
* Import Placemarks from KML (Google Earth browser files) files from other applications or web sites and save them to your device, all while preserving folder structure.
* Import Placemarks from KMZ (Google Earth Compressed Earth browser files) from other applications or web sites and save them to your device, all while preserving folder structure.
* Export some, or all of your locations as KML, also preserving your folder structures.

* Backup your locations as KML to your SD card, or cloud storage, such as Google Drive, and never lose them again.

* Quickly launches your placemarks (saved places) for navigation in Google Earth, Maps and Navigator, Waze, and many others!

Updated Import Function

Each Folder and Place are given unique ids that get written to export files. What this means is that you can repeatedly export and import the KML files and no duplicates will be generated. This makes sharing Places immensely useful for teams or organizations that share KML back and forth.
